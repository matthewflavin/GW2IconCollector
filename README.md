# GW2IconCollector
 Python scripts to download all Item and Skill icons from Guild Wars 2 using their API V.2
 Make sure to change the variable "input_directory" at the top of each script to the desired directory where the icons will be stored.

The folders "skill" and "item" are examples of how the desired directories for each respective script should be organized.
